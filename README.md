# Module-3

This module entailed 
1. Statistical Inference in Data Science
2. Computational Techniques in Data Science 
3. Linear Models 

The courses intertwined through explaining different techniques of statistics such as the types of Probabilities distributions involved such as Bernoulli, Bonimial, Poisson, Gamma, Normal and others. They also explained how you can callulate the Maximum Likelihood Estimation with given parameters, Euler constant, the factorials and other factors that can be involved. 

Besides, they explained the GAMS (Generalized Additive Models) which are extenstion of the GLM ( Genralized Linear Models) and how the predictor variabes can be modeled in non-parametrically as an addition to the linear Models 

The courses also involved the Hypothesis testing, and the involvement of Matrices.
